# Sift

Nothing interesting to see here...I'm just playing with Rust and learning

# Data Model

Loosely based on the [Google Tasks
API](https://developers.google.com/tasks/reference/rest), however that API
is currently crippled. See https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36759725
and https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/166896024. So much for
"Googleâ€™s mission is to organize the world's information and make it
universally accessible and useful."
